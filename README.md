## Weather Forecast

This is a simple bash script that retrieves your current location based on your IP, and using that location, retrieves the weather forecast for the next 3 days.

The location retrieval is possible thanks to the <a href="https://ip-api.com/docs" target="_blank">IP-API</a>  
And the weather forecast is done by the <a href="https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in" target="_blank">WTTR IN Api</a>
